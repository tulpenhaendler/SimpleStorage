# Go SimpleStorage

If you are reading this in github be aware this s mirrored from Gitlab @ gitlab.com/tulpenhaendler/simplestore


This is a Key-Value Store that stores stuff into one single file,

not good for anything complex,
but good if you have a small app and only need to store a little bit of data.
